# LiteGUI Starter Guide #

LiteGUI allows to create powerful and customizable interfaces from Javascript without the need of using HTML.
It has a desktop application look and field so it is not meant to be used in mobile applications.

It is meant to be used in web-apps where the interface could be changed dynamically according to modules or data.

## Widgets ##

It comes with the most common widgets like:
- Text editors
- Numbers (width dragging option)
- Sliders
- Checkboxes
- Combobox
- Open File
- Color picker

And many others, and it is easy to extend to add new ones.

To create Widgets you must use the Inspector class, check the guide about Inspector.

## Areas ##

You can create areas to distribute the space in the web, and split the areas so it can be arranged dynamically.

To know more about Areas check the [LiteGUI.Area](area.md) guide.
